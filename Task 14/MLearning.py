#Supervised Learning:
#In supervised learning problems, a program predicts an                        
#output for an input by learning from pairs of labeled inputs and outputs; that is, the                                
#program learns from examples of the right answers.
#Models of supervised learning include:
    #Support vector machiens(SVMs)
    #Kernel functions
    #Na√Øve Bayes classifiers
    #Adaptive boosting(AdaBoost)

#Unsupervised Learning:
#a progra does not learn from labeled data. Instead, it attempts to discover
#patterns in the data.
#Models of unsupervised learning include:
    #Clustering(K-means Clustering, Heirarchical Clustering, Probabilistic Clustering)
    #Data compresison
    #Deep learning

#Semi-supervised Learning:
#the machine will attempt to devise an algorithm on its own.
#however, the dataset to pull teh data from will need to be "labeled"
#in which each record includes the outcome information.
#Models of seim-supervised learning include:
    #Latent-feature discriminative model (M1)
    #Generative semi-supervised model (M2)
    #Stacked generative semi-supervised model (M1+M2)

#Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates
#analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence
#based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns
#and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
#The implementations of machine learning are nearly limitless.
#It can be used for something as advanced as the self-driving car,that will
#adapt to its surroundings using cameras and/or distance determination based on sound.
#Furthermore, it can be used to monitor the use of floors or rooms in a large building,
#allowing information such as frequency of people using bathrooms on one level compared
#to another bathroom, which will require less stocking of paper towels, or refills of soap.
#The upside is that there will be far fewer mistakes made in operational decision-making.
#However, right now, with our current understanding, machine learning will be completely
#amoral, making its use in military applications very dangerous, depending on how it
#learns who is a threat. It can lead to preemptive attacks for the safety of those it
#considers to be the people its protecting.
